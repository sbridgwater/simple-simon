<h1>Politics and Faith</h1>

Politics and faith politics and faith and me<br> 
everything is fine<br>
just trust in me i am the one for the righteous<br>
i am the one how long must we wait<br>
how long must we wait before everything is fine<br>
it's all the same it's all the same <br>
coming soon to the big screen <br>
coming soon how long must we wait <br>
a crowded room of hidden lies <br>
where people speak about their lives <br> 
but surely not me its all the same <br>
it's all the same coming soon to the big screen <br> 
coming soon to the big screen <br>
how long must we wait how long can we wait <br> 
trust in me politics and faith politics and faith <br> 
and me and me and me and me <br>
it's all the same it's all the same <br> 
coming soon on the big screen <br>
coming soon on the big screen <br>

<h1>Christianity Starts at Home</h1>

A ship in the night i can see the water high <br>
who could tell them no would throw the first stone <br>
they risk their lives for dreams <br>
get to live in peace get to save our souls <br> 
get to smile again and cry like a new born child <br> 
get to save them all free them from their chains <br>
and everybody has the right to live their lives <br>
this is all the words say it all <br>
christianity starts at home <br>
and take our bombs and change them into food <br> 
and feed the starving crowd upon our lawn <br>
don't let it drop don't turn away <br>
help them up into another day a little rain <br> 
a little sun shining down to help that baby grow into a man <br>
what's so wrong to help those that need to be helped <br>
what's so wrong to help those that need to be helped <br>
some day harmony tell them our homes and our food and <br>
our culture our care are all to share <br>
gods on the phone gods on the phone <br>

<h1>We Could Be</h1>

We could be heroes fighting for justice leading the way <br> 
you could be venus i could be famous <br>
we could be all that we desire <br>
admit it all it wouldn't harm <br>
join in the fun we could be cold under a dark sky <br> 
waiting for god to make his move <br>
we could be so out on a tight rope balanced by what we need <br> 
we could be saints i would be nothing without the pain <br>
you could be happy i could be sad nothing would change what we had <br> 
a million laughs a million smiles under the sun <br>
we could be heroes fighting for justice leading the way <br> 
you could be venus i could be famous we could be all that we desire <br>
