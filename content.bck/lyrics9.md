### **Politics and Faith**

Politics and faith politics and faith and me   
everything is fine  
just trust in me i am the one for the righteous 
i am the one how long must we wait  
how long must we wait before everything is fine  
it's all the same it's all the same   
coming soon to the big screen   
coming soon how long must we wait   
a crowded room of hidden lies   
where people speak about their lives    
but surely not me its all the same   
it's all the same coming soon to the big screen    
coming soon to the big screen   
how long must we wait how long can we wait    
trust in me politics and faith politics and faith    
and me and me and me and me   
it's all the same it's all the same    
coming soon on the big screen   
coming soon on the big screen   

### **Christianity Starts at Home**

A ship in the night i can see the water high   
who could tell them no would throw the first stone   
they risk their lives for dreams   
get to live in peace get to save our souls    
get to smile again and cry like a new born child    
get to save them all free them from their chains   
and everybody has the right to live their lives   
this is all the words say it all   
christianity starts at home   
and take our bombs and change them into food    
and feed the starving crowd upon our lawn   
don't let it drop don't turn away   
help them up into another day a little rain    
a little sun shining down to help that baby grow into a man   
what's so wrong to help those that need to be helped   
what's so wrong to help those that need to be helped   
some day harmony tell them our homes and our food and   
our culture our care are all to share   
gods on the phone gods on the phone   

#### **We Could Be**

We could be heroes fighting for justice leading the way    
you could be venus i could be famous   
we could be all that we desire   
admit it all it wouldn't harm   
join in the fun we could be cold under a dark sky    
waiting for god to make his move   
we could be so out on a tight rope balanced by what we need    
we could be saints i would be nothing without the pain   
you could be happy i could be sad nothing would change what we had    
a million laughs a million smiles under the sun   
we could be heroes fighting for justice leading the way    
you could be venus i could be famous we could be all that we desire
