#### Northside
Faces from the northside
memories in the air
someone takes me for a ride
that vacant stare
I wanna be ... with you
Take your home and bring it to me
Love ....
#### I Have a Dream but it's Hurting Me
I had a dream but I'm not too sure i've got the energy to make it come true I had a dream but
I'm not too sure i can stick it I had a dream but I'm not too sure i can pick it
Dreams shouldn't hurt you Dreams shouldn't hurt you I had a dream and it's hurting me bad I had a dream and it's hurting me bad
Dreams shouldn't hurt you Dreams shouldn't hurt you I had a dream but I'm too weak to make it come true.
#### Folly
I can't take it anymore the absolute folly of man
you try to bug me with what you've learned
I can see through you like a glass of water
like a headsman at his own slaughter
where did you get that kind of anger
what have I done to you to merit this treatment
can you really see me or only what you believe
am I myself or what I stand for
are you yourself or what you destroy for
it's easy to destroy but much harder to let grow
apply your acumen for what needs building
isn't harmony what makes music work
what can only be heard when note meets note can you hear my vote
#### Drink from the Cup of Life
Drink from from the cup of life
Bathe in it’s soothing light
Visit the hanging gardens.
Look at the moon’s reflection
Under the tower of babel Over babylon
And the whole earth was of one speech
Where it’s shadow could reach Climb into the sky
Ask not why
Look down on anger
And throw it away
offer milk and honey
Ask for your neighbor to stay Peace, Love and harmony
Three simple words Floating in the air Around roaming lords
#### Arrogant Games
It started as a game
I had myself to blame
I wasn't in control
An arrogance unfolds Of sweat crimes untold
But i cant find the right thing to say
Sliding into nothingness
A massive change in happiness
A relative reply
An arrogance unfolds Of sweat crimes untold
But i cant find the right thing to say
Searching for the truth
Nothing less than absolute
Can save me from the beast
