#### Superman Killed my Lady
And the flowers in the garden growing yellow and green.
And the earth was damp and the sun was shining upon the lawn.
See you by the green gate. See you by the green gate.
Say so, i'm in a certain forn to your goal
And the buds were growing tall
And the water was dripping from the sides of the goal
And the head was sprouting out in a way that you could not see
Be, wait a song, so it fades, so it fades
And the stems were all cut in two, dripping there blood onto the green,
and shivering like an animal in a cage.
You take my money but I say in a month
been waiting for your sad to grow.
Superman killed my lady. Superman killed my lady. Superman killed my lady.
Break into the door.
Lay a hand upon the style, moaning in your head
its grace that you cannot be without,
you could stare but not shout.
