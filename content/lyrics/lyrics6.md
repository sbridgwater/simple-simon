#### A Funeral Lover
Pin me down with a tempered steal lock, turn off the light and pull the lever.
My hairs will rise to the shock, but nothing compares to that grinding shiver.
A dream cut short, a program abort. You left me for another.
A funeral lover.
Shoot me till I'm dead.
Kick me in the balls.
Poison my food but don’t abandon my head.
I don’t want to be Abel and not able to be Cane.
Just Come back to me and rekindle the flame.
Life without you is a world without water.
The tremouring pain of a primal slaughter.
Pin me down with tempered steal
My hairs will rise, my sole will kneel
Turn off my light with a rising fever
Nothing compares to that grinding shiver
(Shoot me till I'm dead) Kick me in the balls.
Poison my food don’t abandon my head.
I don’t want to be Abel and not able to be Cane.
Just Come back to me and rekindle the flame.
Life without you is a world without water.
The tremouring pain of a primal slaughter
You left me for another A funeral lover
#### Final Retreat
I can’t see in the gloom. Take me to my room.
Pull the plug. Set fire to the world and watch it burn.
This is not a love song, Lydon's line. I've loved too much to make it mine.
Pull the plug. Blow out the light. Not enough patience for the fight.
Say hello to the boogy man. He's the only one who'll come in tonight.
It's dark inside. Subversive pride. My voice imprisoned within this hyde.
No one can hear me or touch my pain. I pulled the plug and watched it drain.
A vortex of spinning thoughts. Gathering speed before they're caught.
Disappearing in it’s retreat.
