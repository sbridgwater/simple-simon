#### Free From The Day
Get along and make your way. I need to get home soon.
I feel a need to be with you. And talk about the chosen few.
Free. I feel the wind in my hair and its getting back to you the primary goal.
Forget about the day. Strip down and make it yours.
I'll get around to talk to you. But now let me be free.
I feel the air around my feet.
Water in my eyes drying like mud in the daylight sun.
And its so good to feel alive, to feel the sun, to reach to the sky
And even if the world should end. I'll make it to your door.
I wanna be with you to make things right.
#### The Bus To Ragaton
Gotta get big It's a perfect ride on the bus to ragaton
and now it's time for fun Ale get sunny tonight,
Ale -- it's madness with the light
Beat goes crazy hear the passers by
tapping on the door
Never mind if they hear your maddened roar
and now it's time for more
The door bell rings and now it's time for more
The door bell rings and now it's time for
Colors ride in waves across the door
up to the second floor
madness in it's prime Ale
get sunny tonight, Ale
it's madness with the light
Legs like heavy sharpened hanging stones
lying in my bed the sound of crushing bone waits for the dead
to lay me on their throne
#### Born On A Sugar Field
I can see you standing out of line.
I can hear you walking out of time
You're like a child a child who wants to play
Your like the sun the sun on a foggy day.
Born with a silver spoon on a sugarfield.
You can say born by gods own hands.
A feather in the wind blown to foreign lands.
A fallen piece of gold a fairy tale untold.
You've got me in your hold.
Don't leave me out in the cold
It looks like you were born .... born on a sugar field
