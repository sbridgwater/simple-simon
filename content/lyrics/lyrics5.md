#### A simple and extraordinary life
Save your time to save us any more.
Let me see your friend and my world.
A simple and extraordinary life. Well life is gonna be.
You lived your life to the full and you lived to the full.
In your garden of faith. I was tempted.
You brought me in, you showed me everything.
A simple and extraordinary life.
What's it like in the sky, where the stars shine down.
Whats it like tell me now that you are there to ... in your head.
A simple and extraordinary life.
Saman be all no more Seen my soul.
You lived your life to full In your garden of faith.
I was tempted.
You brought me in, you showed me everything.
A simple and extraordinary life.
#### The Green Line
I was born to be a dreamer.
A yacht on the horizon passing the green line.
I'd like to drop anchor but the sea turns into reason and with huge question marks.
Tick tock the clock strikes six a preface to the real world.
Where people die and babies cry and telephones ring and emotions sting.
I've seen time and time has seen me and I wait patiently
for it to leave the room so i can once again take the green line
