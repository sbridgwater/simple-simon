#### Innocent
I fall the innocent, I fall the innocent
Hell above me falls on me
#### The Bow
And the suns smiles down on your face.
But nothing gets away, and love of a sentimental place.
That you had to give it all, but nothing was the best until your home.
The rest came and placed a little figure on my face.
But your were not the one to live and to be graced.
And all that i could say was getting better on the way home.
Take your face its my right.
Like get it on , take love send it on and invite it on.
It's like it on. And let it go.
