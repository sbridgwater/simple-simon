#### Look to the East
Spread. Spread your wings, spread your wings to an almond sky.
Look. Look to the East for another ride.
Where things are what they seem and one can dream of a better world.
#### I Believe
You've tasted my soul and now you want more.
But i can't give you what you want.
There's not much of it left.
I give most of it away at a philanthropist party.
To a man who said he'd fallen out with jesus a long long time ago.
Why should I feel guilty. I can't satisfy your needs.
I'm a man with limits I am limited by man.
I believe I dont know in what. It's conforting to say.
#### Homercide
Homercide. Won't you get it right. Take your time. Let it go.
#### A Spanish Chant
Keep to the side of the road. Let them pass you by.
You are not safe for now. I'll let you know.
Thoughts of a fight gone by. Tears in my eyes.
And the fever is coming back. I'll let you know.
See you under an olive tree. Light in your hair.
And I want to come home.
