I call myself sIMPLE sIMON for three reasons.

-	I am called Simon Bridgwater
-	I think "_simple_" is "_beautiful_". (I have a degree in Physics and I truly believe that simplicy in Mathematics is "_Beautiful_") 
-	I like the first verse of the nursery rhyme which in my opion has always emphasized the importance of doing for free.

I learnt to play the guitar at University but I never got round to forming a band. Familiar with computers I started to experiment
with composing music with software and found that it was possible to form a virtual band with only one member, me.
All my sundays became sacred not for religious reasons but because I composed Music. I started with indie rock but then got round to
film tracks, reggae, experimental and anything that appealed to my artistic tastes. The music tracks on this site are the fruit of
my efforts. I hope you enjoy the music as much as I enjoyed making it.
